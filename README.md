# SpotiStats 

**SpotiStats** is a mobile-first application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. Its purpose is to let Spotify users explore their listening statistics, including their most-played tracks and favorite artists. The app integrates with the Spotify API, so a Spotify account is required to use it.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The application is a work in progress and is not yet complete. I'm sharing it now because I want to move on to learning Next.js, and I feel like this project is holding me back. However, I hope to continue developing it in my free time, and I believe it serves as a good demonstration of my current skills.

## Features 🚀
- **Spotify Integration**: Log in with your Spotify account.
- **Listening Statistics**: See your top tracks and favorite artists.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices.

## Why React? 🤔
I’m aware that **React** may not be the best choice for building mobile applications, as frameworks like React Native or Flutter are better suited for that purpose. However, I genuinely enjoy working with React and find it a lot of fun to create applications like this one.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve developer experience.
- **Spotify Web API**: To fetch user data and statistics.
- **Vite**: For fast development and bundling.
- **Zustand**: For lightweight and flexible state management.
- **React Query**: For efficient and powerful data fetching and caching.

## How to Run Locally 💻
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SpotiStats.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Add your clientId and clientSecret to ./src/apiKeys file ( you can find them in Spotify For Developers site )
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
    npm run dev

## Next Steps 📈
As I transition to learning Next.js, I plan to:

Explore server-side rendering and API integration in Next.js.
Potentially refactor SpotiStats into a Next.js project in the future.
